## 💼 About Me

I am a Product Manager with 4+ years of experience managing digital products from ideation to launch. I transitioned into tech from a Chemical Engineering background and have since led impactful projects in fintech,  and freelancer marketplaces.

My approach blends business thinking, user empathy, and agile delivery to drive value. I enjoy working with cross-functional teams, writing clear documentation, and creating order from ambiguity.
